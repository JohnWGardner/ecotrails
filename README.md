# Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the basic structure of the app.
- **CSS3**: For layout, color schemes, and basic styles.
- **Bootstrap 4.6**: For responsive layout, styling, and form components.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For the dynamic weather display and API integration.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: To fetch real-time weather and forecast data.
- **GitHub Pages**: For deployment of the live app.

---

# API Integration

- The OpenWeatherMap API is used to retrieve real-time weather and 5-day forecast data based on user input.
- The app uses `fetch` to make asynchronous API calls, processes the JSON responses, and dynamically updates the DOM with weather data.

---

# Design Choices

## Color Scheme

- Warm color scheme used for forecast cards to enhance visual appeal.

## Fonts

- Standard fonts for readability and consistent design.
- Slightly larger, bold fonts for key weather information to improve visibility.

## Wireframes

- Wireframes were created to design the weather app layout:  
  `/workspace/Weather_Web_App/assets/wireframes`
  ![Wireframes](./assets/wireframes/Wireframes.png)

# Testing

## HTML Validation

- Initial HTML validation was done using the W3C Markup Validation Service.

# Bugs

## Five day forecast

- When Adding the JS function for the 5 day forecast errors 401 and 404 were thrown.
  By adding getForecast(search.box) to the event listener we were able to make progress
  but still had error 401.
  We commented out response catch.error at line 50 and this removed the final error.

- There was a single line of duplicate JS code which was preventing the function from  
  runnning correctly. When the duplicate line was removed and an event listener added this resolved the issue.

  ## Forecast loop

  - We created individual Const for date/time, forecast, temperature, description,
    humidity and wind speed. Initial tests caused the code to print directly to the page.
    Further testing showed that we need to tell the function to run in english GB.
    Having corrected this it was no longer printing to screen but the cards were displaying the incorrect day of the week on the forecast cards.

    Adding a let outside of the for loop and a const to grab the relevant HTML information
    along with a const outside of the for loop to grab further information by ID and passing that into the HTML resolved this issue.

  ## Footer

  ### Temporary fix

  - The footer was overlapping with the last forecast card.
  - Adjusted padding and CSS functions in order attempt a fix. This showed no result.
    removed fixed position in HTML and again adjusted CSS to have a sticky or static position which also showed no result.
    Replaced fixed-bottom in HTML and attempted a temporary fix using br between the final
    card and the footer. After adding five of these it has resolved the overlap issue. This will be reviewed in a later iteration.

## Use my location

- We identified that this function was not working. Using dev tools we were able to identify
  that this was due to a lack of information relating to Longitude and latitude.

- By adding an if and else function to both the forecast and five day forecast w hoped t to
  accurately pinpoint a users location by city.
  This initially gave no reponse as the position and the latitude had not been correctly defined. so we altered the temperal literals for the latitude and longitude which then threw a further error 404 under our check weather function.
  As this appeared to be a URL issue we altered fom APIurl to geoForecastURL and geoWeather URL respectively.
  This fixed the cards by showing weather data but assigned no location and the information was not accurate to the testers location having checked this with other existing weather applications.

# Deployment

The app was deployed using **GitHub Pages**:

1. In the GitHub repository, navigate to **Settings**.
2. Select **Pages** from the left-hand menu.
3. Choose the **Main Branch** as the source, then save.
4. The page will automatically be published.

- **Live App URL:** [Weather Web App](https://johnwgardner.github.io/Weather_Web_App)

- We used Agile methodology, with early deployment to see every change live, aiding the development process.

---

# Future Enhancements:
- Geo Location: Although the geo-location feature is functional, it currently retrieves incorrect data and city names. Given more time, we would diagnose and resolve this issue to ensure accurate data retrieval.
- Interactive Map: With additional time, we plan to integrate an interactive map that allows users to hover over and click on a city to get weather conditions.
